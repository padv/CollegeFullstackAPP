# CollegeFullstackApp
Simple PHP, HTML5/CSS3 and Vanilla Javascript APP That I created for a college assignment.

This application will change the user's air conditioning temperature according to his or her preference. When the user enters the room, the system will take the average temperature that the user uses at that specific time and apply it to the air conditioner. If the user gives a command to raise or lower the temperature, these temperatures will be added to the MySQL database.

(Since this was a college project, frontend, variables and comments are all in Brazillian Portuguese. I apologize for that!)
